<p>This is a project written primarily for my own show <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/dashboard/my-shows/published/" target="_blank">The EclectriCAST</a>, but you are free to fork, clone or download the binaries. Expand on it, transform it into something entirely different and just take ideas from it. I would appreciate if you'd contact me, as I could learn or improve my own workflow as well.</p>
